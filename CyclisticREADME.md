INTRODUCTION Scenario: Cyclistic, a Chicago bike-share company that features over 5800 bicycles and 600 docking station has hired me as their junior 
analyst. My manager is Lily Moreno, the Director of Marketing, and she has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual 
riders into annual members.

Data cleaning, validation and exploration was done using PGAdmin - postgresSQL
Data visualization was done using Tableau Public - https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/michael.neumann

To answer key business questions, I followed the six steps of Data Analysis: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share and Act.

ASK
The main business problem we are trying to solve is: 
How do we design a marketing strategy aimed at converting casual riders into annual members? 
To answer this, we must create insight into our business decisions with the following questions:
  1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
  2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
  3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

The business task: finding the differences in two types of Cyclistic users in order to make a highly focused marketing campaign towards
'casual users' in order to turn them into 'membership' holders.

Once we have a better understanding of our users, we will be able to assist our key stakeholders Lily Moreno and the Executive Team.
